# Cucumber-demo: Example Code for Cucumber Tests

This GitHub repository contains example code to help you learn how to use Cucumber for testing.

**Key Features**:
- Cucumber 7 and JUnit 5
- Compatible with Maven
- Requires JDK 21
- Mockito 4.8 (_Non utilis√© dans cette version pour l'instant_)
- Gherkin and stepDefs in both French (FR) and English (EN), including integration of _Examples_
- GitHub Actions (Check the .github/workflows) for straightforward Maven compilation and testing.


## Execution of tests

`mvn test`

expected result:

```

## Organisation of the code

:warning: **Please use the** **pom.xml** file provided to establish the link between JUnit 5 and Cucumber.


:arrow_forward: **Features:** 
The feature description files (Gherkin files) are accessible under [test/resources/features](./src/test/resources/features)

:arrow_forward: **StepDefs:** The implementations corresponding to the steps are defined under tests and follow the same structure as the files describing the scenarios. They refer to the sources located under main.

## Warning
1. Attention: if the classes defining the steps are not public, they are not accessible during execution.
2. Don't forget to adapt **RunCucumberTest.java** classes to your needs.


## Running test with maven (@PhilippeCollet)

By default, maven use its *surefire* plugin to run tests. This plugin is especially built for running unit tests, as it will diretly fail if any test fails. 
This is a good property for preventing the build to be made (the goal *package* will typically fail).

It must be noted that *surefire* will, by default, find tests with the following names and run them during the `test` phase (i.e. just before `package`):

* `"**/Test*.java"` - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that start with "Test".
* `"**/*Test.java"` - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "Test".
* `"**/*Tests.java"` - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "Tests".
* `"**/*TestCase.java"` - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with "TestCase".`
